# Stock Analysis with Visual Basic

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis will look at several stocks to determine recent trends through 2017 and 2018. Using VBA, the analysis will be able to automate much of the process, and present the information in a way that is quickly formatted and easy to understand.

## Results


- Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance of 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script

##Summary

Refactoring code has several advantages and disadvantages. While refactoring this code is a bit time consuming, going back through half of the lines to adjust one by one. However, there are strong advantages in doing so. The refactored code runs much more efficiently as seen in the run time comparisons, and it shortened and simplified the code. With the code simplified and shortened, refactoring it in the future would be easier, and any adjustments in the data would be streamlined. For example, if someone wanted to change the stock tickers to an array of 9, they would only need to adjust the list of ticker names and the length of the array or index range in  7 lines, including the formatting section.
