# Stock Analysis with Visual Basic

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This project will simplify and refactor the original VBA script to streamline the process and reduce execution time. By refactoring the original code, it will work for a larger number of stocks more quickly and present the information in a way that is quickly formatted and easy to understand.

## Results

The original script looped through the data repeatedly to check for each of the values requested, using nested `for` loops. Creating a `tickerIndex` variable allows the code to gather and store the information without the nested `for` loop, resulting in exponentially fewer times looping through the original data. For example, the original code opens a `for` loop for each index of the ticker array and then has a nested `for` loop to check each row's data for the volume, checking every row 12 times:

```
For i = 0 to 11
	For j = rowStart to rowEnd
		If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
			totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
		End If
	Next j
Next i
```

However, in the refactored code, collecting the same information is simplified to:
```
For i = 2 to RowCount
	tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
Next i
```

### Run Time Comparison

Reducing nested `for` loops is a major factor in reducing the run time. Below is the comparison of the execution times for the original and the refactored code for both 2017 and 2018.

It should also be noted that the original code does not inclue formatting, as that was originally a separate subroutine. The refactored code includes formatting.

## Summary

Refactoring code has several advantages and disadvantages. Refactoring working code can be time consuming, going back through many lines to adjust one by one, and may lead to introducing new errors or overlooking something that needs to be updated. However, there are advantages in doing so that may outweigh the risk and time investment. Being able to scale the code to remove specifics and streamline the execution may allow for broader use and easier future refactoring. With this VBA code for stock analysis, simplifying and shortening the code makes refactoring it in the future easier, and any adjustments in the array of tickers would be streamlined. For example, if someone wanted to change the stock tickers to an array of 1000, they would only need to adjust the array of ticker names and the length of the array or index range in  7 lines. The refactored code runs much more efficiently as seen in the run time comparisons, running roughly 9 times faster. When scaled from 12 to 1000 stocks or even more, the run time would add up to a noticeable difference for the user.
